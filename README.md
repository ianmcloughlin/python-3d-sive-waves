# 3D sine waves in Python
This repository contains code for plotting a 2D sine wave in 3D space.
It is written in Python, using the matplotlib library.

## Exercises

1. Change the code to plot cos(x), instead of sin(x).

2. Change the code to fill the area between the plot and the x axis.

3. Add another sine wave, perpendicular to one currently plotted.
